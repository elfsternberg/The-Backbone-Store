The Backbone Store is a simple demonstration application, a Backbone.js
version of the Sammy.js tutorial.

## Installation

The Backbone store must be installed under a webserver in order to
operate correctly.  Chrome, especially, will not initialize the
application from the filesystem.  Just unpack it in a target directory
of your choosing and then browse to that directory.
